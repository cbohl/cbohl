Hey, I'm Chris. :wave: I used to work in Rails but I'm currently focusing on TypeScript, React, and Node. My most recent projects are:
- Vif. A video meeting app that allows users to send GIFs. https://github.com/cbohl/Vif.
- TuneTest. An guessing game app where users try to guess a song based on a MIDI rendition.  https://github.com/cbohl/tunetest-client
